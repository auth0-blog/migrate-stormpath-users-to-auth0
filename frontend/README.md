# Login

This example shows how to add ***Login/SignUp*** to your application using `Lock` widget.

You can read a quickstart for this sample [here](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/angular2/01-login). 

## Getting Started

Rename the `auth0.config.ts.example` file in the `app` directory to `auth0.config.ts` and provide your Auth0 client ID and domain.

Install the npm packages described in the package.json and verify that it works:

```bash
# Install the dependencies
npm install

# Run
npm start
```

The npm start command first compiles the application, then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the lite-server. Both the compiler and the server watch for file changes.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.

You're ready to write your application.

## Important Snippets

### 1. Add lock dependency

```html
/* ===== ./index.html ===== */
<head>
  ...
  <!-- Auth0 Lock script -->
  <script src="http://cdn.auth0.com/js/lock/10.7/lock.min.js"></script>
  ...
</head>
```

### 2. Login with lock

```typescript
/* ===== app/auth.service.ts ===== */
@Injectable()
export class Auth {
  // Configure Auth0
  lock = new Auth0Lock('YOUR_CLIENT_ID', 'YOUR_DOMAIN', {});

  constructor() {
    // Add callback for lock `authenticated` event
    this.lock.on('authenticated', (authResult) => {
      localStorage.setItem('id_token', authResult.idToken);
    });
  }

  public login() {
    // Call the show method to display the widget.
    this.lock.show();
  };
  ...
}
```

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, among others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [JSON Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
